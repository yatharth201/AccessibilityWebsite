      	With funding from the Spencer Foundation, Drs. Rossetti (Boston University) and Burke (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign) conductedcivic engagement trainings with parents of individuals with disabilities in four states. Specifically, in collaboration with Parent Training and Information Centers, civic engagement trainings were conducted in: Illinois, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Tennessee. At the end of the civic engagement training, parents completed short (i.e., 3 minute) videotaped testimonials. The testimonials share their concerns and suggestions for changes in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA, the federal special education law).

			Dr Burke: We traveled to four states (Illinois, Tennessee, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire) to videotape the testimonials of parents of children with disabilities.All parents participated in a six hour training about civic engagement in special education legislation. At the end of the training, participants learned how to speak to legislators using the “hook, line, and sinker”approach (Walsh & Kuriansky, 2009). We provided sample statements for speaking to legislators. With eachsample statement, the participants identified the: (a) the hook (i.e., introduction of the person providing thestatement), (b) line (i.e., presentation of a problem), and (c) sinker (i.e.,suggestion for how to resolve theproblem). Then, the participants were given a worksheet to write their testimonies. The worksheet was primarily blank except for the followingheadings: hook, line, and sinker. Participants individually wrote their own testimonies.On indicating they were done writing, we videotaped their testimonies. All testimonies are less than 3 minutes long.
